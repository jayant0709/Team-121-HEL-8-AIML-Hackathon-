#     "We developed a dynamic interactive platform enabling users to provide feedback through text, audio, and video, with audio and video converted to text. Feedback is analyzed using NLP models for emotions and sentiments, generating an up-to-date report with a dashboard. Data was collected using BeautifulSoup and Selenium, preprocessed with techniques like tokenization, stemming, and stop-word removal, and converted to tensors with PyTorch. Basic RoBERTa models were trained for sentiment and emotion analysis using the Hugging Face Transformers library and AdamW optimizer. The backend was built with Django, and the processed data is stored in a MySQL database for efficient retrieval and reporting.",
